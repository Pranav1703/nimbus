Launch on System Startup
downloadFileIPC -> destPath should be same as filePath (duplication problem exists tho)
uploadFolder(helper func) -> fix drive type problem 

when file is uploaded it gives fake file path
value:"C:\\fakepath\\Screenshot 2025-01-25 202700.png"

root folder is not automatically creted

file watching will stop after app closes, so cant detect changes while app is closed.
work around :
1.Record the State of Files: When your application stops, save the state of the watched files (e.g., checksums). -- done
2.Compare the State on Restart: When the application starts, compare the current state of the files with the previously saved state to identify any changes.-- in progress.
